This repository contains a formalization of some notions of semitopology in Isabelle/HOL.
It follows some of the material in [thix ArXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09287).

The theory is best browsed and edited in
[Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/), but
[`./browser_info/index.html`](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nano-o/Isabelle-Semitopology/master/browser_info/Semi-Topology.html)
contains an HTML rendering of the theory.
